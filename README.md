# RoR2 Import Extensions

RoR2 Import Extensions is a *thunderkit extension* aiming to reduce the time it takes to properly set up a RoR2 Thunderkit Project.

It is extremely recommended to install this and use it in the process of setting up a project, RoR2ImportExtensions can also be used as a use case example on how to extend the Thunderkit Importing Process.
